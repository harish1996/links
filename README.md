# links

## What is this ?

This is a repository with one HTML file, which (can) maintains a collection of useful links, with the help of [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

## But.. Why ?

Using TiddlyWiki, we can collaboratively save links without the need to edit and push to github seperately. Also TiddlyWiki provides tag search which can be useful incase of a huge repository of links.
